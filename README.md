# ClipShare

**Privacy centric screenshot app**

ClipShare is an elegant cross-platform app which copies to clipboard a shortlink to latest screenshot you take.

The main idea is to have the images saved on your own Google Drive (for your own good), and have them be easily previewed like usually.

The most amazing part is that it's your own screenshot, in your own gDrive account, and you decide when and how you share it.

## Features

* auth with Google Drive & save token locally for future uses
* monitor a folder when new screenshots are added
* upload screenshot to Google Drive and share it to anyone with the link
* shorten URL using bit.ly service
